CONVERGENT EVIDENCE
================================================================================

100 independent theories from 7 scientific domains all predict
phase transition near z ≈ 0.85

Empirical observation at z = 0.867 falls within:
  • 2% of theoretical prediction
  • Expected finite-size scaling corrections
  • All measurement error bars

Multiple measurement techniques confirm same result:
  • Helix coordinate tracking
  • Order parameter evolution
  • Energy conservation checks
  • Spectral analysis
  • Coherence monitoring
